# Ising Model
1. ajd_ising.ipynb is the main jupyter notebook that runs the calculations for the Ising Model. The questions are clearly labeled and there are headings for each subproject.

2. calcs.py contains all of the functions needed to run the jupyter notebook. The markdown code in the Jupyter notebook clearly states which functions from this file are used to answer a given problem.

3. MvT_calc.ipynb was used to run the code to generate the two .pkl files. This code computes the magnetization as a function of temperature for four values of the magnetic field.

4. big_M_list.pkl is a binary file which is read into the main jupyter notebook to show the plot of the magnetization as a function of temperature (using 100000 iterations).

5. big_M_list.pkl is a binary file which is read into the main jupyter notebook to show the plot of the magnetization as a function of temperature (using 10000 iterations).

6. Ising_Model_final.pdf is a pdf showing the Jupyter notebook in the final state of its creation.

7. the plots directory contains plots that my code produces.

8. old_code is a python file containing codes that were once useful and may still be useful in the future.
